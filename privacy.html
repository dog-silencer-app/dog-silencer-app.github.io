Dog Silencer captures audio for the purposes of determining volume to
establish when a dog is barking so as to know when to emit a sound to
encourage the dog to quieten down. Audio samples are not kept once the
volume has been measured. No samples are stored in memory or to disk.
No samples are sent over any network or other data connection, either
wired or wireless.

If auto-pause on notification is selected then the read notifications
permission will be requested. This is used only to determine when
notifications arrive for the purpose of pausing the silencer. No
access to the contents of notifications is made.

If auto-pause on call is selected then the phone state
permission will be requested. This is used only to determine when
calls are in progress for the purpose of pausing the silencer. The
requested permission does not grant access to phone numbers or call
history.
